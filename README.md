Project for Udacity course "iOS Networking with Swift"

This iPhone app allows Udacity students to share their location and a URL with fellow students. After logging in, the app downloads information previously posted. This information can be viewed on a map or in a list. The user has options to reload the information, add their own location and URL, or logout.
